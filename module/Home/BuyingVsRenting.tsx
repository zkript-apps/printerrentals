              {`At first glance, you might think that buying printers would be more practical for your company. Well, this is a common misconception among startup businesses. In the hope of saving more, they think that itâ€™s more economical to also shell out more for their operations. But what if this is not the case when it comes to printers? Do you know that it would be more cost-efficient to just rent our printers instead?

The first reason to consider renting is the maintenance of all the units. Upon rental, you will be offered with packages and these packages also come with free maintenance. This means that the unit you are renting, as well as the broken parts and toners, will be supplied since all of these are already included in your chosen package. The convenience is obviously unmatched since you no longer have to think about your cartridges, toners, and inks.`}
